Dear Dr. Curran,

Please consider the enclosed original research article entitled "Spatial modelling of the two-party preferred vote in Australian federal elections: 2001--2016", by Jeremy Forbes, Dianne Cook and Rob J Hyndman, for publication in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics. This study examines the socio-demographic drivers of Australian electoral preference between the Labor and Liberal parties over the six federal elections from 2001 to 2016, using a regression framework. 

A handful of previous studies that analyze the relationship between aggregate socio-demographic characteristics and voter behaviour in Australian federal elections, although nothing more recent than 2007. These studies have been cited in our paper.

In the current study, each of the six federal elections between 2001 and 2016 are modelled separately, with the temporal trends in socio-demographics observed over time. As in the existing literature, Census and election data is used. However, unlike the previous studies, we account for the inherent spatial and temporal misalignment between Census and election data. For each of the 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2013 elections, electoral socio-demographics are imputed using data from the Censuses both before and after the election. This is required as a Census does not occur in these election years. Furthermore, we model spatial structure of electorates in our regression models so that the political climate (an unobserved influence on two-party preference) in neighbouring electorates can effect an electorate's own voting behaviour. This effect is found to be positive in all elections, although it only appears as statistically significant in 2001 and 2016. Over time, the impact of most socio-demographic characteristics do not vary, with industry of work, incomes, household mobility and de facto relationships having consistently strong effects, whilst education and unemployment are amongst those that have varying effects.

We believe that this paper is appropriate for publication by the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics because it applies statistical techniques to uncover insights relevant to the readership of the journal, and importantly, care is taken to adjust for spatial and temporal differences between Census and election data. Finally, the work also provides a resource for future research as all data featured in this study has been contributed to the `eechidna` `R` package (available on CRAN), so that readers are able to access and explore this data themselves, should they wish to do so.

This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.  We have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

Thank you in advance for your consideration!

Sincerely,
